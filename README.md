# Duolang

## Philosophy

Any reached Duolingo tree can execute (no undefined behavior), just maybe not meaningful

Legendary makes coding programs easier, but anything can be written without it

Hello world should be achievable in the Spanish from English tree

Duolang is a meta language, and programs are different based on the underlying language (language pair tree)
